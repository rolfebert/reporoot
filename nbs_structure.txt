Number of entries allowed:  An exhibitor is limited to one tray in each award entered. A 
member may enter any number of Presentation and Sponsored awards unless the member 
is mailing trays (see above). An exhibitor may enter a maximum of 10 trays in Open 
competition.  
AWARD SUBMISSION PROCEDURE  
Eligibility:  Any member of the National Button Society may submit Awards in writing 
to the Awards Chair.  
Writing an award:  Choose the division, class(es), size(s) and quantity of buttons. If you 
choose multiple classes, use the plus (+) sign between classes. The class (es) you choose 
determine the priority in judging. For example, if you choose a pictorial class with no 
further specialization, judges should credit the pictorial content of each entry more heav i-
ly than materials, shapes, etc. You can further specialize yo ur award by design, subject, 
color, etc. (for example, a bird award specialized to birds in flight; a white glass award 
specialized to Art Deco designs). Designate unlisted classes only if a specialization  
cannot be assigned to a listed class. Identifying  studios and/or labeling of  makers is 
strongly encouraged. If you wish, you can specify mounting and/or labeling requir e-
ments in your award description. Make your description clear and concise so that entrants 
and judges understand your intent. Highly spec ialized awards usually reduce the number 
of entrants. If you wish, you can limit your award to certain competitors (for example, 
first-time entrants). The Awards Chair may edit awards if necessary. Awards of questio n-
able taste, self -promoting awards aimed at sales, or other awards not in the best interest 
of the NBS are not accepted.  
Prize amount:  The standard minimum prize donation is $10 ($5 first prize, $3 second, 
$2 third) but you are free to designate and submit larger amounts.  
Submission deadline:  The award submission form is published in the May issue of the
